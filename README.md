# Fake News Detection
## Problem Description
The internet today has become a very useful tool in getting information. The information we get usually plays a major role in defining our perception on matters such as political, health, culture things that in one way or another affects our daily lives and our relationship with other people. So it is important that the information we get is true and is not misleading in any sort of way.

But this has not been the case in quite a number of instances. Every now and then we get to hear of cases of people spreading misinformation through social media posts or blog posts. And this has been on rise of late
Quite a number of techniques have been used to curb this problem. One of the major way has been to use machine models to detect fake news articles.

In this project, we are going to build a classification model that will classify a news article as either fake or not fake. We will make use of varoius Natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. This is an end-to-end machine learning project that will involve all the necessary steps that is usually carried out in machine learning project, from building the models to model registry to deploying the models to model monitoring.
## Data Used
We will make use data from the following sources;
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rchitic17/real-or-fake

These  datasets are for training, testing and  validation purposes.
